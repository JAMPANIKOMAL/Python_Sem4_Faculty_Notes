    "Multithreading in Python allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently, which can help improve the performance of I/O-bound tasks. However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, making it less effective for CPU-bound tasks."
